# VBA Green Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to analyze green stocks from 2017 and 2018. Market information was pulled from twelve companies covering 3,000 rows of data.

Not only that, but the code was structured so that anyone can gather this information with a click of a button.
